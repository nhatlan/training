            <h4>FAQ section</h4>
            <p>Why should you become the designer?
Because designers are expensive and templates are created without any understanding of the problem they propose to solve. With basic

knowledge, you can create a design that is more than good enough to launch a new business.

Who is this book for?
The book is written primarily for programmers, but founders of al  backgrounds and skill sets will learn just as well. Those not fam 

with coding might not recognize a couple of terms, but the core principles are accessible to everyone.

Does the book cover this or that specific design topic?
This book contains the minimum design fundamentals that bootstrappers must understand in order to launch a business.
My intent is to emphasize design basics. You’ll notice some topic  even popular ones, are absent. This is not because such topics are unimportant but because they are neither suitable for beginne 

nor relevant to their bottom line.

Note about .ePub & .Mobi formats:
For better viewing of the graphics and illustrations, consider us 

the PDF version of this eBook. The .ePub and .Mobi formats provi  limited control over graphics and typography, and thus are less   for a design book. I've made every effort to ensure they are rea 

and useful for quick reference.</p>
